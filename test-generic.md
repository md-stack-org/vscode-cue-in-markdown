# CUE Syntax Highlighting Test

This is a test file to demonstrate CUE syntax highlighting in Markdown code blocks.

## Basic CUE Example

```cue
package example

#GenericTypeInMD: {
    kind: string
}
```

This test file demonstrates various CUE language features that should be properly syntax highlighted when the extension is working correctly.
